      For the completion of the Data & Society Capstone course at Seattle Pacific University, our class was asked to
      follow the guidelines of the 2022 Data Challenge Expo put on by by the American Statistical Association.
    </p>
    <p>These guidelines include: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Contestants must use at least one of the five data sets selected from the Urban Institute Data Catalog</li>
      <li>Contestants must combine their chosen data set with at least one other publicly available data set.
        One option is to use another data set from the list. More details can be found
        <a href="https://community.amstat.org/dataexpo/home">here</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Sourced from the American
      Community Survey (ACS) and provided by the
      <a href="https://datacatalog.urban.org/dataset/household-conditions-geographic-school-district">Urban Institute</a>,
      this dataset describes the share of households
      within a geographic school district between 2014 and
       2018 under conditions that may affect remote K-12
       learning environments. T
    </p>
    <h3>A Look at the Data</h3>
      <p>These five-year estimates of household conditions within a geographic school district are calculated based on aggregate Census
      survey data for households within each school district’s geographic location. Because of this, some estimates may include
      households without school-aged children (noted in descriptions) which is partly accounted for in each estimate’s corresponding margin of error.</p>

      <h4>Margin of Errors</h4>
      <p>Because each household condition is an estimate, this dataset
        includes a margin of error variable for each estimate.
        The Census Bureau has documentation of the methodology used by
        the ACS to calculate estimates and margin of errors.</p>

      <h4>Dealing with Margin of Error Columns</h4>
      <p>The Margin of Error columns for the estimates were originally formatted 0%-100%.
        We transformed these MOEs into one-sided margin of errors for easier use later on.
        <li>There are no NA values in the dataset, but there are many estimates that have Margin of Errors of .5 which means these
          estimates are likely not accurate. Thus, we filtered out all school districts with MOEs of .5</li>

    <h3>Our Process</h3>
    <p>
      Our data process was neither uniform, nor organized. Our final research question was informed by the exploration of our given
      dataset as well as many other school district topics--a process that took most of the quarter. You will be able to follow the
      evolution of our project and research question through our weekly
      <a href="https://github.com/jonmgeiger/household-conditions/tree/reproducibility/slides">powerpoint updates.</a>
      Along with the powerpoint updates, we completed anlayses each week to document our data exploration and findings as we started
      the process of deciding our research question. Here are the analyses in order of when they were completed. These can also be
      found in the
      <a href="https://github.com/jonmgeiger/household-conditions/tree/main/analyses">analysis directory</a>
       but they are not in order).

  <h3>Research Question</h3>
  <p>
    Based upon our observations throughout the quarter, we became interested graduation rates and specifically how we could predict a district's graduation rate based upon different indicators. This led us to our main reserach question:
    <br><h5>To what extent can we use household conditions, race, assessment scores, and school funding to predict school district graduation rates in the United States?</h5>
  </p>
  <h3>Methodology</h3>
  <p>
    The first step of this question was which regression model would be most reflective of the data we had. Through the
    tidymodels package in r we were able to run 8 different models to assess which one would be the most accurate.
    Through these trial runs, we found that the gradient boosted tree and random forest models were the most accurate models
    for predicting graduation rates.
