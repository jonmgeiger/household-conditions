      <h4>Childern (SAIPE* estimate)</h4>
      <p>An estimate of children between the ages 5-17 who are enrolled
        in school within a certain geographic school district. A
        child is estimated to be enrolled in a school district if
        they live within the boundaries of the district and their
        “assigned grade is within the grade range for which the
        district is financially responsible”
        <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/programs/edge/Demographic/ACSchildren">(EDGE)</a>.
        This estimate
        does not account for children who are enrolled in private
        school or those who attend school outside the boundaries
        of their geographically assigned public-school district. <br>
        <br><em>* yearly estimate made by US Census Bureau’s Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates (SAIPE) Program based on Census responses.</em>
        </p>
      <h4>Condition Estimates</h4>
      <p>These five-year estimates of household conditions within
        a school district are calculated based on aggregate Census
        survey data for households within each school district’s
        geographic location. Because of this, some estimates may
        include households without school-aged children (noted in
        descriptions) which is partly accounted for in each
        estimate’s corresponding margin of error.</p>
      <h4>Poverty (SAIPE estimate)</h4>
      <p>A student is considered to be in poverty if their family’s
        income is at or below 100 percent of the federal poverty level.
        The poverty level changes each year and is calculated based
        on how many people are living in a household.
        (See poverty rates between 2014 and 2018 according to the
        <a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/topics/poverty-economic-mobility/poverty-guidelines/prior-hhs-poverty-guidelines-federal-register-references">HHS Poverty Guidelines)</a>
        </p>
      <h4>Linguistically Isolated</h4>
      <p>A student is considered linguistically isolated if no one at
        or above the age of 14 speaks English as their first language,
        or who speaks English “very well” as their second language.</p>
      <h4>Childern with Disability</h4>
      <p>Students who have cognitive, ambulatory, independent living,
        selfcare, vision, or hearing difficulties are considered to be
        children with disability.</p>
      <h4>Single Parents</h4>
      <p>Students have single parents if they are living in a
        household with only one father or one mother.</p>
      <h4>Parents in Vulnerable Economic Sectors</h4>
      <p>Parents are considered to be in vulnerable economic sectors if
        they earn less than 800 dollars a week and works in industries
        that are most likely to be laid off. This includes those working
        in the entertainment, service, and retail industries.
        <li>Parents of a household are defined as the householder and his or her spouse or partner.</li>
      </p>
      <h4>Crowded conditions</h4>
      <p>Students are considered to be living crowded conditions if there
        is less than one room per household member. A room is a space
        enclosed by walls, a floor and a ceiling. This excludes bathrooms,
        porches, balconies, foyers, halls, and unfinished basements.
        This estimate is calculated for all occupied households, including
        households without students.</p>
      <h4>Lack of Computer of Broadband Internet</h4>
      <p>Students living in a household without a computer or without
        broadband internet connection. This estimate includes household
        with non-dial-up internet in its definition of broadband.
        This estimate also considers desktop computers, laptops,
        smartphones and tablets as computers.</p>
      <h4>Margin of Errors</h4>
      <p>Because each household condition is an estimate, this dataset
        includes a margin of error variable for each estimate.
        The Census Bureau has documentation of the methodology used by
        the ACS to calculate estimates and margin of errors.</p>
