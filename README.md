# Household Conditions by Geographic School District
Sourced from the American Community Survey (ACS) and provided by the [Urban Institute](https://datacatalog.urban.org/dataset/household-conditions-geographic-school-district), this dataset describes the share of households within a geographic school district between 2014 and 2018 under conditions that may affect remote K-12 learning environments. The following page will carfully define each variable in the data set. 

## Variables 

### School ID:
School ID appears to be arbitrarily assigned. 

### State: 
Includes all 50 States of the US.

### School District: 
A geographic school district is defined as a public-school district that has geographic boundaries reported by a state. This does not include private schools or charter school systems unless they have geographic boundaries that are reported by the state.  

### Children (SAIPE\* estimate): 
An estimate of children between the ages 5-17 who are enrolled in school within a certain geographic school district. A child is estimated to be enrolled in a school district if they live within the boundaries of the district and their “assigned grade is within the grade range for which the district is financially responsible” [(EDGE)](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/edge/Demographic/ACSchildren). This estimate does not account for children who are enrolled in private school or those who attend school outside the boundaries of their geographically assigned public-school district.

## Condition Estimates: 

### Poverty (SAIPE estimate): 
A student is considered to be in poverty if their family’s income is at or below 100 percent of the federal poverty level. The poverty level changes each year and is calculated based on how many people are living in a household. 
_(See poverty rates between 2014 and 2018 according to the [HHS Poverty Guidelines](https://aspe.hhs.gov/topics/poverty-economic-mobility/poverty-guidelines/prior-hhs-poverty-guidelines-federal-register-references))_


### Linguistically Isolated: 
A student is considered linguistically isolated if no one at or above the age of 14 speaks English as their first language, or who speaks English “very well” as their second language. 

### Children with Disability: 
Students who have cognitive, ambulatory, independent living, selfcare, vision, or hearing difficulties are considered to be children with disability. 

### Single Parents: 
Students have single parents if they are living in a household with only one father or one mother.

### Parents in vulnerable economic sectors: 
Parents are considered to be in vulnerable economic sectors if they earn less than 800 dollars a week and works in industries that are most likely to be laid off. This includes those working in the entertainment, service, and retail industries.    
- Parents of a household are defined as the householder and his or her spouse or partner. 

### Crowded Conditions: 
Students are considered to be living crowded conditions if there is less than one room per household member. A room is a space enclosed by walls, a floor and a ceiling. This excludes bathrooms, porches, balconies, foyers, halls, and unfinished basements. This estimate is calculated for all occupied households, including households without students. 

### Lack of computer or broadband internet: 
Students living in a household without a computer or without broadband internet connection. This estimate includes household with non-dial-up internet in its definition of broadband. This estimate also considers desktop computers, laptops, smartphones and tablets as computers.

### Margin of Errors:
Because each household condition is an estimate, this dataset includes a margin of error variable for each estimate. The Census Bureau has documentation of the methodology used by the ACS to calculate estimates and margin of errors.
